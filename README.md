## Conclusion

Based on the analysis that has been carried out regarding geographic distribution and its impact on the success of YouTube Channels, the following are the conclusions that draw the common thread from all the analysis and calculations:

1. **Domination of Large Countries**: The United States and India as two countries with large populations and internet penetration show dominance in YouTube content based on the number of subscribers. This indicates that for brands or creators looking to achieve broad market penetration, focusing on these markets can provide significant benefits.
2. **Content Categories and Local Preferences**l: Although music is the dominant category in many countries, local preferences greatly influence popular content categories. Brands or creators who want to achieve success in a particular market must consider local culture and trends.
3. **Channel Duration Does Not Guarantee Success**: Although older channels generally have a larger customer base, engagement levels are not always positive as the channel ages. A sustainable and adaptive content strategy is more important than just the age of a channel.
4. **Level of Urbanization Can Have an Impact, But Not Significantly**: Although there are indications that the level of urbanization influences channel success, this impact is not statistically significant. Nonetheless, focusing on highly urbanized areas may provide better opportunities for growth due to greater internet penetration.
5. **Growth in Subscribers is Related to Views**: The positive correlation between growth in subscribers and growth in video views indicates that improving one aspect will improve the other aspect. As a strategy, focusing efforts on one metric can impact other metrics.
6. **Unemployment Rate Does Not Determine Success**: Although it is believed that the unemployment rate can affect the number of creators, analysis shows that there is no significant relationship between the unemployment rate and the success of a YouTube channel.
